# NORTH CYPRUS TRAFFIC ACCIDENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM

## Examination of my project:
Home
As you can see, the project consists of a single page. and it has a very simple and understandable theme but is fully responsive.
The aim of the project is to store traffic accidents in Northern Cyprus in a real-time database and display the current number of accidents and deaths. and at the same time, it offers the opportunity to filter all accidents that have occurred according to weather conditions, road conditions, date, city and reasons. By filtering, you can view the number of traffic accidents that occurred in the city you want on the date you want, their causes or other factors. At the same time, we can see the list of accidents that occurred in the last month.
Data add panel
In the data adding panel, after the expressions such as road condition, weather, year, month, day, city, number of deaths are filled in, the reasons are written and added to the database and appear on our home page.

Data delete panel
The data deletion panel first filters the criteria we have selected in order to quickly delete the incorrect data we have added and to prevent misinformation by adding it again, and then the data we want to delete is selected.
